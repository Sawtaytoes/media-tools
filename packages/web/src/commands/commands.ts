// ─── Command definitions ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Each entry describes one API command the sequence builder can wire up.
// `tag` groups commands in the picker; `fields` lists the parameters the
// command accepts; `outputFolderName` is the subfolder suffix this command
// writes its output into (null = writes in-place or caller supplies path).
//
// Migration in progress: command entries are gradually being rewritten to
// pull `name`, `description`, `default`, and `required` from their Zod
// request schemas via `fieldBuilder`. This makes field-name typos a
// compile error and stops server-side `.default(...)` values from
// drifting away from the UI's hard-coded defaults. UI-only attributes
// (type, label, lookupType, visibleWhen, …) stay on the override object.
// Commands not yet migrated keep their plain literal `fields` arrays.
