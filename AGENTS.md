# AGENTS.md

Guidelines for AI agents working on this codebase.

## Project

A Node.js CLI and REST API for batch media file operations (MKV track manipulation,
file renaming, subtitle merging, etc.) using mkvtoolnix, ffmpeg, and mediainfo.

## Key conventions

### Package manager

Use `yarn` and `yarn dlx`, not `npm` and `npx`. The repo's lockfile is `yarn.lock`; mixing the two desynchronizes installs. Examples: `yarn vitest run` (not `npx vitest run`), `yarn dlx <pkg>` (not `npx <pkg>`).

### Observable-first
Every command module returns an `Observable`. Errors are handled via `catchNamedError`
(which logs via `console.error` and returns `EMPTY` — they do not surface as observable
errors to the subscriber).

### Pure functions / no direct mutation
State updates must go through store functions that return new objects (spread-based).
Do not mutate object properties directly (e.g. `job.status = "x"` is wrong;
use `updateJob(id, { status: "x" })` instead).

### No `process.exit()` in modules
`process.exit()` belongs only in `src/cli.ts` handlers. Any `tap(() => process.exit())`
in module files must be removed before those modules can be used in the API.

### Variable naming
- No single-letter variable names. Always use descriptive names that convey purpose.
- No two- or three-letter abbreviations either (e.g. `lv`, `pv`, `el`, `msf`, `idx`). Spell the word out — `linkedValue`, `pathVar`, `element`, `mainSourceField`, `index`.
- Hono route handler context: use `context` (not `c`). Example: `app.get("/", (context) => context.json({}))`.
- Spell out all abbreviations in variable names (e.g. `destination` not `dest`, `source` not `src`, `options` not `opts`, `value` not `val`, `error` not `err`, `response` not `resp`).
- Function names take an action verb; variables hold the noun the function returns. `linkedVal` is wrong on two counts — it abbreviates `Value`, and as a function it should describe the action: `getLinkedValue` is the function, and the variable that captures its result is `linkedValue`.
- **Booleans must start with `is` or `has`.** This includes function parameters, object properties, schema fields, CLI flags, and local variables. `deleteSourceOnSuccess` is wrong — `isSourceDeletedOnSuccess` reads as a question and matches the existing `isRecursive` / `hasChapterSyncOffset` / `hasFirstAudioLanguage` patterns. The prefix tells a reader at a glance that the value is yes/no, not a string or function.

### Coding style
- Functional style; prefer `concatMap` / `mergeMap` over imperative loops
- For iterating arrays, use functional methods (`forEach`, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, etc.) instead of `for...of` loops
- Imports sorted alphabetically within each group
- Observable pipelines broken across lines (see existing modules for reference)
- Always use multi-line braced `if` bodies, even for early returns and one-liners. Don't write `if (!cmd) return null` — write:

  ```ts
  if (!cmd) {
    return null
  }
  ```

  Same rule for `else`, `for`, `while`. The brace cost is one line; the safety against silent edit mistakes (adding a second statement that quietly falls outside the conditional) is worth it.

## Testing

### Unit tests (vitest)

- Framework: vitest. Run with `yarn test`.
- `node:fs` and `node:fs/promises` are globally mocked with `memfs` (see `vitest.setup.ts`)
- Tests live next to their source file: `foo.ts` → `foo.test.ts`
- Use `captureConsoleMessage` / `captureLogMessage` helpers to silence and inspect console output
- Use `vol.fromJSON(...)` from memfs to seed the virtual filesystem

### App-command tests (memfs-backed)

App commands return Observables and write through `node:fs/promises`, so the unit-test pattern is: seed the virtual filesystem with `vol.fromJSON`, run the observable to completion via `firstValueFrom(... .pipe(toArray()))` (or `lastValueFrom` for the final emission), then assert filesystem state with `stat` / `readFileSync`. See `flattenOutput.test.ts` and `deleteFilesByExtension.test.ts` for the canonical shape.

Errors swallowed by `catchNamedError` complete the observable as `EMPTY` rather than rejecting — assert `emissions).toEqual([])` and use `captureConsoleMessage('error', ...)` to capture the logged reason.

### Hono route tests (in-process)

Each sub-app (e.g. `jobRoutes`, `queryRoutes`) is an `OpenAPIHono` instance — exercise it directly with `subApp.request(url, init)`; no real HTTP server needed. See `src/api/routes/jobRoutes.test.ts` (in-memory state via `jobStore`, reset in `afterEach`) and `src/api/routes/queryRoutes.test.ts` (filesystem-backed routes seeded with `vol.fromJSON`) for examples. POST helper:

```ts
const post = (path: string, body: unknown) => subApp.request(path, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify(body),
})
```

Query routes that wrap filesystem / network calls return `{ ..., error: string | null }` at HTTP 200 instead of 500-ing — assert on `body.error`, not on `response.status`.

### Browser-driven tests (Playwright Test)

- Framework: `@playwright/test`. Tests live in `e2e/*.spec.ts`.
- Run headless once: `yarn e2e`. Run interactively: `yarn e2e:ui` (opens Playwright's UI mode for stepping through).
- `playwright.config.ts` boots `yarn api-server` automatically before tests run; in dev it reuses an already-running server, in CI it starts a fresh one.
- The first run requires `yarn install-playwright-browser` to fetch the Chromium binary.
- For tests that depend on backend data (search/lookup/listDirectoryEntries), use `page.route('**/queries/<endpoint>', ...)` to stub the network rather than hitting real services. See the path-typeahead test in `e2e/builder.spec.ts` for the pattern.
- Generated artifacts (`playwright-report/`, `test-results/`) are gitignored.

## API (`src/api/`)

Split into focused modules:

| File | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| `types.ts` | `Job` and `JobStatus` types |
| `jobStore.ts` | In-memory job state — all updates via exported functions |
| `logCapture.ts` | `AsyncLocalStorage`-based console routing; call `installLogCapture()` once at startup |
| `jobRunner.ts` | `runJob(jobId, observable)` — sets status, wires SSE subject |
| `routes/jobs.ts` | `GET /jobs`, `GET /jobs/:id` |
| `routes/logs.ts` | `GET /jobs/:id/logs` (SSE) |
| `routes/commands.ts` | `POST /jobs/<command>` endpoints |
| `index.ts` | Assembles the Hono app (no `serve()` call) |

`src/api.ts` is the entry point: imports the assembled app from `src/api/index.ts`
and calls `serve()`.

## Adding a new command

1. Create `src/<commandName>.ts` returning `Observable<unknown>`
2. Create `src/cli-commands/<commandName>.ts` using the `CommandModule` pattern (see below)
3. Import and `.command(...)` the module in `src/cli.ts`
4. Add a `app.post("/jobs/<commandName>", ...)` handler to `src/api/routes/commands.ts`

## Sequence Runner DSL

External API consumers should read the **Sequence Runner** section of [README.md](README.md) — that's the source of truth for how `paths`, `'@pathId'`, `linkedTo`/`output`, and the `/sequences/run` endpoint compose. The implementation lives in [src/api/resolveSequenceParams.ts](src/api/resolveSequenceParams.ts), [src/api/sequenceRunner.ts](src/api/sequenceRunner.ts), [src/api/routes/sequenceRoutes.ts](src/api/routes/sequenceRoutes.ts), and the per-command `extractOutputs` / `outputFolderName` / `outputComputation` declarations in [src/api/routes/commandRoutes.ts](src/api/routes/commandRoutes.ts). The canonical multi-step example is [examples/process-anime-subtitles.yaml](examples/process-anime-subtitles.yaml).

## CLI command modules (`src/cli-commands/`)

Each yargs command lives in its own file. The pattern uses `InferArgvOptions<T>` to
extract the plain options type from the builder, avoiding the `[key: string]: unknown`
index signature that `Awaited<ReturnType<typeof builder>>["argv"]` would produce:

```typescript
import type { Argv, CommandBuilder, CommandModule } from "yargs"
import { someCommand } from "../someCommand.js"

type InferArgvOptions<T> = T extends Argv<infer U> ? U : never

const builder = (yargs: Argv) => (
  yargs
  .positional("sourcePath", { demandOption: true, type: "string", describe: "..." })
  .option("isRecursive", { alias: "r", boolean: true, default: false, nargs: 0, type: "boolean", describe: "..." })
)

type Args = InferArgvOptions<ReturnType<typeof builder>>

export const someCommandCommand: CommandModule<{}, Args> = {
  command: "someCommand <sourcePath>",
  describe: "...",
  builder: builder as CommandBuilder<{}, Args>,
  handler: (argv) => {
    someCommand({ isRecursive: argv.isRecursive, sourcePath: argv.sourcePath })
    .subscribe(() => { console.timeEnd("Command Runtime") })
  },
}
```

In `cli.ts`, register it with `.command(someCommandCommand)`.

## Commit conventions

Commit *as you go*, not at the end of the session. After each logical group of changes lands and tests pass, commit it — one phase at a time. Don't batch a multi-step task into a single end-of-session commit just because the work all happened in one conversation; the user reviews incrementally, and a single 10-file commit is much harder to read than three focused 3-file commits.

If a single file legitimately touches two unrelated concerns (e.g. a feature change and an infrastructure fix in the same route file), keep them in separate commits — use `git add -p` to selectively stage hunks, or temporarily revert one set with the Edit tool, commit the other, then re-apply. Mixing is the wrong shortcut.

Natural commit points: a todo item flips to completed, a phase of a Plan-mode plan finishes, tests pass for a self-contained change, a refactor wraps up before the next one starts.

Do not push unless explicitly asked.

## makeDirectory

`makeDirectory(directoryPath)` always creates the exact path passed to it using `mkdir(..., { recursive: true })`. Callers that have a **file** path must pass `dirname(filePath)` themselves — `makeDirectory` does not strip the filename. This applies to `getAudioOffset.ts` and `reorderTracksFfmpeg.ts`; callers like `copyFiles.ts` and `splitChaptersFfmpeg.ts` already pass directory paths and need no wrapping.

## Commands that read `process.stdin`

`nameAnimeEpisodes` and `nameTvShowEpisodes` historically prompted via stdin to pick a search result. They now accept an optional `malId` / `tvdbId` parameter that bypasses stdin entirely. Always supply these IDs when calling these commands from the API or sequence builder — omitting them will hang waiting for stdin input.
