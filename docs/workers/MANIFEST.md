# Worker Manifest — Mux-Magic Huge Revamp

This is the live tracking document for all workers in the Mux-Magic huge revamp. The full plan lives at [PLAN.md](PLAN.md).

## How to use this file

- **Workers:** update your own row's `Status` column at start (`in-progress`) and end (`done`) — that's all you edit here. Everything else in your row is set when the prompt file was written.
- **Spawning a worker:** open the worker's prompt file at `docs/workers/<id>_<slug>.md`, paste the contents into a fresh Claude Code session, and let it run.
- **Adding a new worker mid-plan:** pick the next unused 2-hex code (sequential), add a row in the appropriate phase section, and create the prompt file. Never renumber existing workers.
- **Parallelism rule:** workers in the same phase may run in parallel iff their file-glob domains don't overlap. Phase 1A is strictly serial (all touch `eslint.config.js`); the rest of Phase 1B fans out across web/other/cross-repo tracks.

## Status values

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `planned` | Row exists, prompt file not yet written |
| `ready` | Prompt file written; can be spawned |
| `in-progress` | Worktree exists; work is happening |
| `blocked` | Has a `Depends on` not yet satisfied OR ran into a question for the user |
| `done` | PR merged into `feat/mux-magic-revamp` |

## Tracks

| Track | Owns |
|---|---|
| `tools` | `packages/tools/**` (renamed from `packages/shared/**` in worker 39), root configs, `.github/**`, top-level docs, `AGENTS.md` |
| `web` | `packages/web/**` only |
| `srv` | `packages/server/**` only |
| `cli` | `packages/cli/**` (new package created in Phase 2) |
| `cross` | `Gallery-Downloader` repo (formerly `Media-Sync`) + cross-repo coordination |
| `infra` | CI, vitest configs, playwright config, ESLint/Biome configs |

## Phase 0 — Rebrand foundation (parallel; ⇒ merges to master)

| ID | Slug | Track | Model | Effort | Thinking | Depends | Status |
|:--:|---|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| 39 | [shared-to-tools-rename](39_shared-to-tools-rename.md) | tools | Sonnet | High | ON | — | done |
| 01 | [mux-magic-rename](01_mux-magic-rename.md) | tools | Sonnet | High | ON | 39 | done |
| 02 | [npm-publish-key-setup](02_npm-publish-key-setup.md) | tools | Haiku | Low | OFF | — | done |
| 03 | [storybook-vitest-filter-fix](03_storybook-vitest-filter-fix.md) | infra | Sonnet | Medium | ON | — | done |
| 04 | [worker-conventions-agents-md](04_worker-conventions-agents-md.md) | tools | Haiku | Low | OFF | — | done |

**Spawn recommendation:** start `39`, `02`, `03`, `04` in parallel (each touches small, disjoint files; `39` owns the `packages/shared/` → `packages/tools/` rename plus selective migration of reusable utilities from `packages/server/src/tools/`). Run `01` (full rebrand pass) AFTER all four have merged, so `01` only renames `@media-tools/tools` → `@mux-magic/tools` (no leftover `@mux-magic/tools` references).

## Phase 1A — High-blast-radius ESLint config (serial)

All three workers touch `eslint.config.js` and must run sequentially.

| 28 | [threadcount-variable-registry-unification](28_threadcount-variable-registry-unification.md) — cleanup follow-up to worker 11: registers `threadCount` in the unified Variables registry from worker 36 (was a parallel side-channel); makes TypePicker registry-driven. Originally slotted for the Phase 4 structured-logging worker; that worker relocated to id `41` per the "never renumber" rule. | web | Sonnet | Medium | ON | 11, 36, 37 | ready |

| 32 | [lookup-types-from-server](32_lookup-types-from-server.md) — migrates [LookupModal/types.ts](../../packages/web/src/components/LookupModal/types.ts) to import canonical `LookupSearchResult`/`LookupType`/`LookupRelease` from `@mux-magic/server`; eliminates the `eslint-disable no-restricted-syntax` bypass installed by worker 06. `LookupVariant`/`LookupGroup` stay web-only (UI synthesis); `LookupState`/`LookupStage` stay web-only (state machine). | srv+web | Sonnet | Medium | ON | 01, 06 | done |

---

## Phase 3 — Name Special Features overhaul

The existing `nameSpecialFeatures` code is preserved (renamed only by worker 22, then split into modules by worker 3a). Two new sibling commands are added for narrower workflows, plus a shared "DVD Compare ID variable" concept that lets steps reference each other's lookup IDs (similar to path variables). Workers 25, 26, 27 then improve specific subsystems of the renamed command.

| ID | Slug | Track | Model | Effort | Thinking | Depends | Status |
|:--:|---|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| 22 | [nsf-rename-to-dvdcompare-tmdb](22_nsf-rename-to-dvdcompare-tmdb.md) — rename existing `nameSpecialFeatures` → `nameSpecialFeaturesDvdCompareTmdb`; **code unchanged** | srv+web | Sonnet | Medium | ON | 21 | done |
| 3a | [nsf-pipeline-split-into-modules](3a_nsf-pipeline-split-into-modules.md) — behavior-preserving split of the 1,325-line NSF pipeline into focused modules. Unblocks parallel improvements in 25/26/27 | srv | **Opus** | High | ON | 22 | in-progress |
| 23 | [nameMovieCutsDvdCompareTmdb-new-command](23_namemoviecuts-dvdcompare-tmdb-new-command.md) — new command: rename movies + move into directories by edition. Uses TMDB + DVD Compare | srv+web+cli | Sonnet | High | ON | 22, 35, 3a | ready |

## Phase 4 — Server infrastructure

> Note: the structured-logging worker (originally numbered `28`) is now `41` — slot `28` was reassigned to a Phase 1B follow-up before the Phase 4 prompts were written. Plan rule: never renumber existing workers.

| ID | Slug | Track | Model | Effort | Thinking | Depends | Status |
|:--:|---|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| 41 | [structured-logging](41_structured-logging.md) — structured logger in `@mux-magic/tools` bridged to `appendJobLog`; AsyncLocalStorage trace correlation via synthetic-uuid `startSpan`; migrates server job-context `console.*` calls; ships `/api/logs/structured` SSE feed. No new runtime deps. | srv+cli | Sonnet | Medium | ON | 21 | ready |
| 2a | [server-template-storage](2a_server-template-storage.md) — file-backed `/api/templates` CRUD + web sidebar; templates become the canonical reusable form, URL query stays as the share-this-instance mechanism | srv+web | Sonnet | High | ON | 01 | ready |
| 2b | [error-persistence-webhook](2b_error-persistence-webhook.md) — on-disk job-error store + delivery state machine with backoff; boot-time replay of pending webhook deliveries; `/api/errors` routes | srv | Sonnet | Medium | ON | 41 | ready |
| 2c | [pure-functions-sweep](2c_pure-functions-sweep.md) — extract pure cores from `packages/server/src/tools/**`; thin wrappers retain exported signatures; refactor-only, no behavior changes; excludes `nameSpecialFeatures*` (Phase 3) and `app-commands/**` (worker 38) | srv+web | Sonnet | High | ON | 20 | ready |
| 2d | [asset-fallback-to-cli](2d_asset-fallback-to-cli.md) — CLI probes a healthy server; on transport failure (refused/timeout/DNS), read-only commands run locally via `@mux-magic/tools` instead of failing | srv+cli | Haiku | Low | OFF | 01, 20 | ready |
| 38 | [per-file-pipelining](38_per-file-pipelining.md) — rewire `sequenceRunner.ts` to stream files through steps via rxjs composition; file 1 hits step 3 while file 2 still on step 1. Multiplies value of worker 11's thread budget | srv | **Opus** | High | ON | 20, 21, 41 | ready |
| 3b | [extract-subtitles-multi-language-type-filter](3b_extract-subtitles-multi-language-type-filter.md) — multi-language `subtitlesLanguages` array, tri-state `typesMode` (`none\|include\|exclude`) + `subtitleTypes` chip picker, single batched `mkvextract` call per file. Removes hardcoded image-codec auto-skip. | srv+web+cli | Sonnet | Medium | ON | 20 | planned |
| 3c | [bcp47-language-variants](3c_bcp47-language-variants.md) — BCP 47 locale variants (`zh-Hans-CN`, `zh-Hant-HK`, `pt-BR`, …) via optional `ietf` field on `LanguageSelection`. Augments 3-letter codes, emits `language-ietf` to mkvpropedit/mkvmerge alongside legacy `language`. Secondary "Region/Variant" picker appears only for curated base languages. | srv+web+cli | Sonnet | Medium | ON | 08, 20 | planned |
| 3e | [gallery-downloader-task-pools](3e_gallery-downloader-task-pools.md) — adds named per-task-type concurrency pools to `@mux-magic/tools` taskScheduler (third admission dimension alongside global cap + per-job claim); adopts in Gallery-Downloader so image downloads, Webtoons lookups, DLsite scrapes, etc. each get their own rate-limit-derived cap. Two PRs — mux-magic API extension publishes first, then gallery-downloader bumps and adopts. | tools+cross | Sonnet | High | ON | 21, 1d + a published `@mux-magic/tools` minor bump after 21 | ready |
| 40 | [file-organization-commands](40_file-organization-commands.md) — ports three PowerShell housekeeping scripts to native commands: `moveFilesIntoNamedFolders` (each file → same-named subfolder), `distributeFolderToSiblings` (copy a folder — defaults to `./attachments` — into every sibling dir, optional source-delete), `flattenChildFolders` (move all files from every immediate child dir up to parent, optional empty-dir cleanup). Uses `fs.rename` for the same-volume moves and `aclSafeCopyFile` for the cross-volume distribute. | srv+web+cli | Sonnet | Medium | ON | 20 | ready |

Also collapses `InsertDivider` to a three-control layout (Step, Group ▾ dropdown, Paste). | srv+web | Sonnet | High | ON | 27, 35, 36, 25 (soft) | ready |

## Open Questions — resolved

All originally-flagged questions now have decided answers. Captured here for traceability:

| Worker | Decision |
|:--:|---|
| 11 | **Per-job setting, not server-persisted.** Env var stays as the system ceiling; user picks per-sequence value via UI (clamped). Stored in YAML template + URL query string. Server exposes `GET /system/threads` for the UI to display the ceiling. Worker 11 prompt updated. |
| 22 | **Keep existing code; rename only.** `nameSpecialFeatures` → `nameSpecialFeaturesDvdCompareTmdb`. Add two NEW sibling commands (workers 23 and 34) + shared DVD Compare ID variable concept (worker 35). The original command stays so the user can compare behavior before deprecating it. |
| 24 | **`sourcePath` internal, "Source Path" user-facing.** No further naming question. |
| 27 | **State name: `paused`** (clean lifecycle: pending → running → paused → complete/failed). Separate `reason` field for human-readable cause (e.g. `reason: user_input`). |
| 2f | **Opus confirmed** for FFmpeg GPU re-encode — AI struggles without a browser to verify and the failure mode is "looks right, doesn't work." |
| 33 | **Manual smoke testing required** in addition to standard gates. User performs the manual pass; this worker doesn't automate beyond gates. |

## Test coverage discipline (applies to every worker)

This is on top of TDD-failing-test-first (already in [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md)). Goal: catch bugs before the user encounters them in manual use.

- **Adding functionality:** write tests covering the new behavior.
- **Updating functionality:** add or update tests to reflect the change.
- **e2e tests:** valuable for full sequence runs, modal flows, undo/redo, drag-and-drop; less so for pure-presentation changes.
